# Customer Churn Analyst

Customer churn analytics is a personal project for which I use a non-realistic dataset. The primary goal of this project is to demonstrate my analysis process and how it translates into Python code. 

This project defines customer demographics, geographics, and other characteristics with the objective of finding out how churn customers experience the companyâ€™s products. From there, churn analysis is implemented to figure out the fundamental reasons why customers leave the company.
